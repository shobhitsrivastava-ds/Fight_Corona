# Fight_Corona

This repository demonstrates the working of a web app which makes prediction about the COVID19 disease. The user is required to upload the CAT-Scan image of the patient's heart, which is further fed into the AI model which makes predictions about the patient being affected by Covid19 or not.

Enter the following commands to run the app:
* For Windows<br>
                                                       $ set FLASK_APP=app<br>
                                                       $ flask run
                                          
* For Linux users <br>
                                                       $ export FLASK_APP=app<br>
                                                       $ flask run<br>
                                          
Now copy the link from the command line and open it in the web browser and then you are good to go.
