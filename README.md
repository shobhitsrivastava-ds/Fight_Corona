This repository demonstrates the working of a web app which makes prediction about the COVID19 disease. The user is required to upload the CAT-Scan image of the patient's chest, which is further fed into the AI model which makes predictions about the patient being affected by Covid19 or not.

## Enter the following commands to run the app:
* For Windows<br>
                                                 $ set FLASK_APP=app<br>
                                                 $ flask run
                                          
* For Linux users <br>
                                                 $ export FLASK_APP=app<br>
                                                 $ flask run<br>
                                          
Now copy the link from the command line and open it in the web browser and then you are good to go.
